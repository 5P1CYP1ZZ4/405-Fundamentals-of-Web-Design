<p>Corn was domesticated about 10,000 years ago in what is now Mexico. Archaeologists discovered that people have known about popcorn for thousands of years. Fossil evidence from Peru suggests that corn was popped as early as 4,700 BC. Through the 19th century, popping of the kernels was achieved by hand on stove tops. Kernels were sold on the East Coast of the United States under names such as Pearls or Nonpariel. The term popped corn first appeared in John Russell Bartlett's 1848 Dictionary of Americanisms. Popcorn is an ingredient in Cracker Jack and, in the early years of the product, it popped by hand.</p>

<p>Each Kernel of popcorn contains a certain amount of moisture and oil. Unlike most other grains, the outer hulll of the popcorn kernal is both strong and impervious to moisture and the starch inside consists almost entirely of a hard type. As the oil and water within the kernel are heatted, they turn the moisture in the kernel into pressurized steam. Under these conditions, the starch inside the kernel gelantinizes, softens, and becomes pliable. The internal pressure of the entrapped steam continues to increase until the breaking point of the hull is reached. Special varieties are grown to give improved popping yield. Though the kernels of some other types will pop, the cultivated strain for popcorn is Zea mays everta, which is a special kind of flint corn.</p><br>

<p>Popcorn can be cooked with butter and oil. Although small quanities can be popped in a stove-top kettle or pot in a home kitchen, commerical sales of freshly popped popcorn employs specially designed popcorn machines, which were invented in Chicago, Illinois, by Charles Cretors in 1885. Cretors successfully introduced his invention at the Columbian Exposition in 1893. At this same world's fair, F. W. Rueckhiem introduced a molasses-flavored "Candied Popcorn", the first caramel corn; his brother, Louis Ruekheim, slightly altered the recipe and introduced it as Cracker Jack popcorn in 1896.</p><br>
<p><span id="nutrition" class="paragraphHeadings">Nutritional Value</span></p>
<p>Air-popped popcorn (no salt or other addiives) is 4% water, 78% carbohydrates (including 15% dietary fiber), 12% protein, and 4% fat (table). In a 100 gram refrence amount, popcorn provides 382 calories and is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of riboflavin (25% DV) and several dietary minerals, particularly manganese, phosphorus, and zinc (36-45% DV). B vitamins and other minerals are in appreciable amounts.</p><br>

<p>In the popcorn industry, a popped kernel of corn is known as a "flake". Two shapes of flakes are commericially important. "Butterfly" (or "snowflake") flakes are irregular in shape and have a number of protruding "wings". "Mushroom" flakes are largely ball-shaped, with a few wings. Butterfly flakes are regarded as having better mouthfeel, with greater tenderness and less noticeable hulls. Mushroom flakes are less fragile than butterfly flakes and are therefore often used for packaged popcioirn or confectionery, such as caramel corn.[19] The kernels from a single cob of popcorn may form both butterfly and mushroom flakes; hybrids that produce 100% butterfly flakes or 100% mushroom flakes exist, the latter developed only as recent as 1998. Growing conditions and popping environment can also affect affect the butterfly-to-mushrooom ratio. When referring to multiple pieces of popcorn collectively. ot os acceptable to use the term "popcorn". When referring to a singlular piece of popcorn, the accepted term is "kernel".</p>
